# Yet another boilerplate project for universal react apps

**This is still under construction. Thank you for your interest, you might just come again a litte later :-)**

To use this, just do

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

then go to localhost:3000 and everything should work.
In case no styles are visible, restart once with `npm run dev`.
